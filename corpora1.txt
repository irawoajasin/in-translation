My mother gives birth to apparition
Her children exist in company of shadows

I learn not to be afraid of the dead
My father teaches how to exist among hauntings

He houses inherited pain in his prayers
Expels his demons in his drinking

We watch our home crack open in seance
How our ancestors dance history alive

Our parents are vessels of antiquity
Rejoicing, mourning, reveling in our lineage

Trace these lines, they’ll lead to ruptured paradise
Curious creatures swallowing the fullness of earth

In suspended portrait, a tree shields their bodies
Watch—my mother’s mother give birth to ghosts

One week later in the strange
exhilaration after Lucille’s death

our eyes were bright as we received instructions,
lined up with all we were supposed to do.

Now seers, now grace notes, now anchors, now tellers,
now keepers and spreaders, now wide open arms,

the cold wind of generational shift
blew all around us, stinging our cheeks,

awakening us to the open space
now everywhere surrounding.
