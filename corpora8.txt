I don’t believe I thought

or gave names in any known language.

I spoke of myself always

in the third person. What led up to it,

I hadn’t the faintest idea. I only knew the Event

itself took place. Constant discrepancies. To throw them

off, I laughed, talked—all games

and amusements—to escape from the burden of my own

internal history. But I was there

trying for once to see you,

longed so to see you.

I might meet you in the street:

a bicycle leaning up against the wall

by the window. Rendered laws of my country

played before my face. Historical, two-souled,

forgotten, unknown freaks of memory.
 
The matter of debts, the violent death

of a near relation, and all landing

at the faintest conception. Dark. Blue. And then.

All I can remember is when I saw you. 

It was you or anyone else. 

The shot seemed to end

all. It belongs to the New World:

the Present all entangled, unable

to move. Everything turned round

and looked at you.
